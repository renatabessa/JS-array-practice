Practicing array in a bookstore website

<h4>PROJECT:</h4>
This project is a bookstore website.<br>
You can use the buttons to filter the books that will appear on screen.<br>
Fot that, I used JS to filter the information and change the books that are displayed.<br><br>

I´ve used this project to learn more about arrays and how to use it´s methods.<br>
I also developed consuming an API at https://guilhermeonrails.github.io/casadocodigo/livros.json<br>

It has improved my knoledge in JS and prepared me for new chalenges. <br>
